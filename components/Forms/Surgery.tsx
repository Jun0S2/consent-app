          CONSENT FOR SURGERY/ PROCEDURE or TREATMENT
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          1. I hereby authorize Dr.Hailey Park, DNP as may be selected to
          perform the following procedure or treatment:
          <br />
          <strong>
            <div className="p-3">
              FACIAL FILLER INJECTION (list the anatomic areas where filler will
              be injected) <br />I have received the following information
              sheet: INFORMED CONSENT â€“ FACIAL FILLER INJECTION
            </div>{" "}
          </strong>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          2. I recognize that during the course of the procedure and medical
          treatment or anesthesia, unforeseen conditions may necessitate
          different procedures than those above. I therefore authorize the above
          physician and assistants or designees to perform such other procedures
          that are in the exercise of his or her professional judgment necessary
          and desirable. The authority granted under this paragraph shall
          include all conditions that require treatment and are not known to my
          physician at the time the procedure is begun. <br />
          <br />
          3. I consent to the administration of such anesthetics considered
          necessary or advisable. I understand that all forms of anesthesia
          involve risk and the possibility of complications, injury, and
          sometimes death. <br />
          <br />
          4. I understand what my surgeon can and cannot do, and understand
          there are no warranties or guarantees, implied or specific about my
          outcome. I have had the opportunity to explain my goals and understand
          which desired outcomes are realistic and which are not. All of my
          questions have been answered, and I understand the inherent (specific)
          risks to the procedures I seek, as well as those additional risks and
          complications, benefits, and alternatives. Understanding all of this,
          I elect to proceed.
          <br />
          <br />
          5. I consent to be photographed or televised before, during, and after
          the operation(s) or procedure(s) to be performed, including
          appropriate portions of my body, for medical, scientific or
          educational purposes, provided my identity is not revealed by the
          pictures.
          <br />
          <br />
          6. For purposes of advancing medical education, I consent to the
          admittance of observers to the treatment room.
          <br />
          <br />
          7. I realize that not having the procedure is an option.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>
            8. IT HAS BEEN EXPLAINED TO ME IN A WAY THAT I UNDERSTAND: <br />
            <div className="p-3">
