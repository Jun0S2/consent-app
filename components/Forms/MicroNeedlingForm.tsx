        <br />
        <p className="text-lg font-bold">What is the purpose of this form?</p>
        <p>
          The purpose of this form is to help inform you and to help you decide
          if you want to have this procedure done to you. You should take part
          in the procedure only if you want to. Before you decide if you want to
          take part in this procedure, it is important that you read the
          information below. This form may use words you do not understand.
          Please ask the doctor or the clinic staff to explain any words or
          procedures that you do not clearly understand.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="text-lg font-bold">Description of the Procedure</p>
        <p>
          Micro EVO pen, the first-to-market and U.S Food and Drug
          Administration-cleared microneedling device clinically-proven solution
          to safely and effectively improve the appearance of facial acne scars
          for people age 22 and above. The EvoPen also improves the appearance
          of wrinkles on the neck.
          <br />
          Microneedling procedures are performed in a minimally-invasive (little
          to no introduction of the instrument into the body) and precise manner
          with the use of the sterile needle head. The procedure is normally
          completed within 30–60 minutes, depending on the required procedure
          and anatomical site.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="text-lg font-bold">Side Effects</p>
        <p>
          After the procedure, the skin will be red and flushed in appearance,
          like a moderate sunburn. You may also experience skin tightness and
          mild sensitivity to touch on certain areas. This will diminish
          significantly within a few hours following the procedure. Within the
          next 24 hours, the skin will often appear to have returned to normal.
          After three days, there is rarely evidence that the procedure has
          taken place.

        <p className="text-lg font-bold">Precautions and Warnings</p>
        <p>
          Safety and Effectiveness for settings greater than 1.5 mm has not been
          evaluated on the face. Universal precautions are necessary during
          microneedling. Microneedling should not be used within the orbital rim
          of the eye, such as the eyelids. The EvoPen System has not been
          evaluated in the following patient populations (i.e. patients with the
          following conditions or taking the following medications): Actinic
          (solar) keratosis; collagen vascular diseases or cardiac
          abnormalities; diabetes; eczema, psoriasis and other chronic
          conditions in the treatment area or on other areas of the body;
          immunosuppressive therapy; history of contact dermatitis; raised moles
          in the treatment area; rosacea; active bacterial, fungal, or viral
          infections (i.e. herpes, warts); keloid scars (a scar that grows
          outside of the boundaries of an original scar); patients on
          anticoagulants; scars and stretch marks less than one year old;
          scleroderma; and wound- healing deficiencies

        <p className="text-lg font-bold">Patient Consent</p>
        <p>
          I understand that results of microneedling procedures will vary among
          individuals. I understand that although I may see a change after my
          first procedure, I may require a series of sessions to obtain my
          desired outcome. The procedure and side effects described in this
          consent have been explained to me including alternative methods, as
          have the advantages and disadvantages of microneedling.
          <br />
          I have been advised that though good results are expected, the
          possibility and nature of complications cannot be accurately
          anticipated, therefore, there can be no guarantee as expressed or
          implied either as to the success or other results of the microneedling
          procedure. I am aware that the microneedling procedure is not
          permanent and natural degradation may occur over time.
          <br />
          I have read (or it has been read to me) and I understand this consent
          and I understand the information contained in it.
          <br />
          I have had the opportunity to ask any questions about the
          microneedling procedure including risks or alternatives, and I
          acknowledge that all my questions about the procedure have been
          answered in a satisfactory manner.
          <br />
          <br />
          This consent form is valid until all or part is revoked by me in
          writing.
