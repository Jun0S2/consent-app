          Weight Management (semaglutide) Prescription Drug Management Consent
        </p>

        <p>
          This document is intended to serve as a confirmation of informed
          consent for compounded semaglutide, which is a prescription weight
          management medication.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="font-bold">A. Patient Informed Consen</p>
        <p>
          1. I voluntarily request that Hyeyeon Park, DNP, CRNP (provider)
          treats my medical condition. <br />
          2. I have informed my provider of any known allergies, my medical
          conditions, medications, social/family history. <br />
          3. I have the right to be informed of any alternative options, side
          effects, and the risks and benefits. <br />
          4. I understand the mechanism of action of the medication. <br />
          5. I understand how it is to be administered. <br />
          6. I understand the prescription will come from a compounding
          pharmacy, which is not FDA approved. I have been told that the
          manufacturing facility itself is FDA monitored along with third party
          testing on the medication itself. <br />
          7. Prices may vary and change. My charge will include my time with
          Hyeyeon Park (in person and via communication outside of the office),
          supplies, and medication. <br />
          8. Hyeyeon Park may change the pharmacy based on several factors
          (availability, shipping time, cost). Hyeyeon Park will tell you as
          this happens. <br />
          9. It has been explained to me that this medication could be harmful
          if taken inappropriately or without advice from the provider. <br />
          10. I understand this medication may cause adverse side effects (see
          below). I understand this list is not complete and it describes the
          most common side effects, and that death is also a possibility of
          taking this medication. I understand symptoms may be worse after there
          has been a change in my medication dose or when first starting the
          medication. <br />
