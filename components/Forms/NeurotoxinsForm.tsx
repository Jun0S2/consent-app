          Xeomin(Botulinum A Toxin)/BOTOX(Botulinum A Toxin)
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            with Botulinum A Toxin (Xeomin) in the areas agreed upon with Dr.
            Hyeyeon Park, DNP to partially paralyze these muscles temporarily.
            These may include muscles associated with the glabella, forehead,
            crow’s feet, sad lines, upper lip, or lower face.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br />

        <p>
          Botulinum A Toxin (Xeomin) injection has been FDA approved for use in
          the cosmetic treatment for glabellar frown lines only – the wrinkles
          between the eyebrows and lateral canthal lines (crow’s feet) in
          adults. Injection of Xeomin into the small muscles between the brows
          causes those specific muscles to halt their function (be paralyzed),
          thereby improving the appearance of the wrinkles. I understand the
          goal is to decrease the wrinkles in the treated area. This paralysis
          is temporary, and re-injection is necessary within three to four
          months. It has been explained to me that other temporary and more
          permanent treatments are available.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The possible side effects of Xeomin include but are not limited to:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>
              1. Risks: I understand there is a risk of swelling, rash,
              headache, local numbness, pain at the injection site, bruising,
              respiratory problems, and allergic reaction.
            </strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2.Infection: </strong>
            Infections can occur which in most cases are easily treatable but in
            rare cases a permanent scarring in the area can occur.
          </li>
          <li>
            3.Most people have lightly swollen pinkish bumps where the
            injections went in, for a couple of hours or even several days.
          </li>
          <li>
            4. Although many people with chronic headaches or migraines often
            get relief from Xeomin, a small percent of patients get headaches
            following treatment with Xeomin, for the first day. In a very small
            percentage of patients these headaches can persist for several days
            or weeks.
          </li>
          <li>
            5. Local numbness, rash, pain at the injection site, flu like
            symptoms with mild fever, back pain.
          </li>
          <li>
            6. Respiratory problems such as bronchitis or sinusitis, nausea,
            dizziness, and tightness or irritation of the skin.
          </li>
          <li>
            7. Bruising is possible anytime you inject a needle into the skin.
            This bruising can last for several hours, days, weeks, months and in
            rare cases the effect of bruising could be permanent.
          </li>
          <li>
            8. While local weakness of the injected muscles is representative of
            the expected pharmacological action of Xeomin, weakness of adjacent
            muscles may occur as a result of the spread of the toxin.
          </li>
          <li>
            9. Treatments: I understand more than one injection may be needed to
            achieve a satisfactory result.
          </li>
          <li>
            10. Another risk when injecting Xeomin around the eyes included
            corneal exposure because people may not be able to blink the eyelids
            as often as they should to protect the eye. This inability to
            protect the eye has been associated with damage to the eye as
            impaired vision, or double vision, which is usually temporary. This
            reduced blinking has been associated with corneal ulcerations. There
            are medications that can help lift the eyelid, however, if the
            drooping is too great the eye drops are not that effective. These
            side effects can last for several weeks or longer. This occurs in
            2-5 percent of patients.
          </li>
          <li>
            11. I will follow all aftercare instructions as it is crucial I do
            so for healing.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <p>
          Given the above, I understand that response to treatment varies on an
          individual basis and that specific results are not guaranteed.
          Therefore, in consideration for any treatment received, I agree to
          unconditionally defend, hold harmless and release from any and all
          liability the company and the individual that provided my treatment,
          the insured, and any additional insured’s, as well as any officers,
          directors, or employees of the above companies for any condition or
          result, known or unknown, that may arise as a consequence of any
          treatment that I receive.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I have fully disclosed on my client intake form any medications,
          previous complications, or current conditions that may affect my
          treatment. I understand and agree that any legal action of any kind
          related to any treatment I receive will be limited to binding
          arbitration using a single arbitrator agreed to by both parties.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As Xeomin is not an exact science, there might be an uneven appearance
          of the face with some muscles more affected by the Xeomin than others.
          In most cases this uneven appearance can be corrected by injecting
          Xeomin in the same or nearby muscles. However in some cases this
          uneven appearance can persist for several weeks or months. This list
          is not meant to be inclusive of all possible risks associated with
          Xeomin as there are both known and unknown side effects associated
          with any medication or procedure. Xeomin should not be administered to
          a pregnant or nursing woman.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Additionally, the number of units injected is an estimate of the
          amount of Xeomin required to paralyze the muscles. I understand there
          is no guarantee of results of any treatment. I understand the regular
          charge applies to all subsequent treatments. I understand and agree
          that all services rendered to me are charged directly to me and that I
          am personally responsible for payment. I further agree in the event of
          non- payment, to bear the cost of collection, and/or Court cost and
          reasonable legal fees, should this be required.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          By signing below, I acknowledge that I have read the foregoing
          informed consent and agree to the treatment with its associated risks.
          I hereby give consent to perform this and all subsequent Xeomin
          treatments with the above understood. I hereby release the doctor, the
          person injecting the Xeomin and the facility from liability associated
          with this procedure
