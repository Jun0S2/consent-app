            The RHA® Collection of resilient hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers
            includes RHA Redensity™, RHA® 2, RHA® 3 and RHA® 4. RHA
            Redensity™ is for injection into the facial tissue for the
            correction of moderate to severe dynamic perioral rhytids; and RHA®
            2 and RHA® 4 are for the correction of moderate to severe dynamic
            facial wrinkles and folds, such as nasolabial folds, in adults 22 or
            older. RHA® 3 is for the correction of moderate to severe dynamic
            facial wrinkles and folds, such as nasolabial folds, and also used
            to augment lip fullness in adults 22 or older.

        <p className="text-xl font-bold">GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
        <p>
          The injection will utilize a stabilized product used to smooth
          moderate to severe facial wrinkles and folds around the nose and mouth
          or shape facial contours. Semi-permanent filler injections are
          customized for every patient, depending on his or her particular
          needs. These can be performed in areas involving the face and eyelid
          region, forehead, and lips. Fillers cannot stop the process of aging.
          They can however, temporarily diminish the look of wrinkles and soft
          tissue depressions. Filler injections may be performed as a singular
          procedure, in combination with other treatments such as BOTOX®, or as
          an adjunct to a surgical procedure. Filler injections require regional
          nerve blocks or local anesthetic injections to diminish discomfort.
          Soft tissue fillers produce temporary swelling, redness, and needle
          marks, which resolve after a few days time. Continuing treatments are
          necessary in order to maintain the effect of fillers over time. Once
          injected, fillers will be slowly absorbed by the body. The length of
          effect for injections is variable.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="text-xl font-bold">ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS</p>
        <p>
          Alternative forms of management include not treating the skin wrinkles
          or soft tissue depressions by any means. Improvement of skin wrinkles
          and soft tissue depressions may be accomplished by other treatments:
          laser treatments, chemical skin-peels, dermabrasion, or other skin
          procedures, alternative types of tissue fillers, or surgery such as a
          blepharoplasty, face or brow lift when indicated. Risks and potential
          complications are also associated with alternative forms of medical or
          surgical treatment.

        <br />
        <p className="text-xl font-bold">RISKS OF FILLER INJECTIONS</p>
        <p>
          Every procedure involves a certain amount of risk and it is important
          that you understand these risks and the possible complications
          associated with them. In addition, every procedure has limitations. An
          individual’s choice to undergo this procedure is based on the
          comparison of the risk to potential benefit. Although the majority of
          patients do not experience the following, you should discuss each of
          them with your physician to make sure you understand the risks,
          potential complications, limitations, and consequences of facial
          filler injections. Additional information concerning Hylaform may be
          obtained from the package-insert sheets supplied by INAMED; Juvederm
          may be obtained from the package-insert sheets supplied by Allergan
          Aesthetics; Restylane Filler may be obtained from the package-insert
          sheets supplied by Medicis Aesthetics; Radiesse filler may be obtained
          from the package-insert sheets supplies by BioForm Medical Inc.
          Problems associated with the use of tissue fillers can relate to
          normal occurrences following tissue filler injections, or potential
          complications following tissue filler injections.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="text-xl font-bold">
          Normal Occurrences During Tissue Filler Injections
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Bleeding and Bruising:</strong> It is possible, though
          unusual, to have a bleeding episode from a filler injection or local
          anesthesia used during the procedure. Bruising in soft tissues may
          occur. Should you develop post-injection bleeding, it may require
          emergency treatment or surgery. Aspirin, anti-inflammatory
          medications, platelet inhibitors, anticoagulants, Vitamin E, ginkgo
          biloba and other “herbs / homeopathic remedies” may contribute to a
          greater risk of a bleeding problem. Do not take any of these for seven
          days before or after filler injections.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Swelling:</strong> Swelling (edema) is a normal occurrence
          following the injections. It decreases after a few days. If swelling
          is slow to resolve, medical treatment may be necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Pain:</strong> Discomfort associated with injections is normal
          and usually of short duration.
        </p>
        <h3>Specific Risks of Filler Injections</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Needle Marks:</strong> Visible needle marks from the
          injections occur normally and resolve in a few days.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Acne-Like Skin Eruptions:</strong> Acneiform skin eruptions
          can occur following the injection of tissue fillers. This generally
          resolves within a few days.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Skin Sensitivity:</strong> Skin rash, itching, tenderness and
          swelling may occur following injections. After treatment, you should
          minimize exposure of the treated area to excessive sun or UV lamp
          exposure and extreme cold weather until any initial swelling or
          redness has gone away. If you are considering laser treatment,
          chemical skin peeling or any other procedure based on a skin response
          after filler treatment, or you have recently had such treatments and
          the skin has not healed completely, there is a possible risk of an
          inflammatory reaction at the implant site.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Infection:</strong> Although infection following injection of
          tissue fillers is unusual, bacterial, fungal, and viral infections can
          occur. Herpes simplex virus infections around the mouth can occur
          following a tissue filler treatment. This applies to both individuals
          with a past history of Herpes simplex virus infections and individuals
          with no known history of Herpes simplex virus infections in the mouth
          area. Specific medications must be prescribed and taken both prior to
          and following the treatment procedure in order to suppress an
          infection from this virus. Should any type of skin infection occur,
          additional treatment including antibiotics may be necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Erythema (Skin Redness):</strong> Erythema in the skin occurs
          after injections. It can be present for a few days after the
          procedure.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Under / Over Correction:</strong> The injection of soft tissue
          fillers to correct wrinkles and soft tissue contour deficiencies may
          not achieve the desired outcome. The amount of correction may be
          inadequate or excessive. It may not be possible to control the process
          of injection of tissue fillers due to factors attributable to each
          patient’s situation. If under correction occurs, you may be advised to
          consider additional injections of tissue filler materials.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Asymmetry:</strong> The human face is normally asymmetrical in
          its appearance and anatomy. It may not be possible to achieve or
          maintain exact symmetry with tissue filer injections. There can be a
          variation from one side to the other in terms of the response to
          injection. Addressing this may require additional injections.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Damage to Deeper Structures:</strong> Deeper structures such
          as nerves and blood vessels may be damaged during the course of
          injection. Injury to deeper structures may be temporary or permanent.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Skin Lumpiness:</strong> Lumpiness can occur following the
          injection of fillers. This tends to smooth out over time. In some
          situations, it may be possible to feel the injected tissue filler
          material for long periods of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Visible Tissue Filler Material:</strong> It may be possible to
          see any type of tissue filler material that was injected in areas
          where the skin is thin.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Granulomas:</strong> Painful masses in the skin and deeper
          tissues after a filler injection are extremely rare. Should these
          occur, additional treatments including surgery may be necessary.
          Fillers should not be used in areas with active inflammation or
          infections (e.g., cysts, pimples, rashes or hives).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Migration of Filler:</strong> The filler substance may migrate
          from its original injection site and produce visible fullness in
          adjacent tissue or other unintended effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Skin Necrosis:</strong> It is very unusual to experience death
          of skin and deeper soft tissues after injections. Skin necrosis can
          produce unacceptable scarring. Should this complication occur,
          additional treatments, or surgery may be necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Allergic Reactions and Hypersensitivity:</strong> As with all
          biologic products, allergic and systemic anaphylactic reactions may
          occur. Fillers should not be used in patients with a history of
          multiple severe allergies, severe allergies manifested by a history of
          anaphylaxis, or allergies to gram-positive bacterial proteins.
          Allergic reactions may require additional treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Drug and Local Anesthetic Reactions:</strong> There is the
          possibility that a systemic reaction could occur from either the local
          anesthetic or epinephrine used for sensory nerve block anesthesia when
          tissue filler injections are performed. This would include the
          possibility of light-headedness, rapid heartbeat (tachycardia), and
          fainting. Medical treatment of these conditions may be necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Antibodies to Fillers:</strong> Presence of antibodies to
          hyaluronic acid tissue fillers may reduce the effectiveness of this
          material or produce a reaction in subsequent injections. The health
          significance of antibodies to hyaluronic acid tissue fillers and other
          fillers is unknown.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Accidental Intra-Arterial Injection:</strong> It is extremely
          rare that during the course of injection, fillers could be
          accidentally injected into arterial structures and produce a blockage
          of blood flow. This may produce skin necrosis in facial structures or
          damage blood flow to the eye, resulting in loss of vision. The risk
          and consequences of accidental intravascular injection of fillers is
          unknown and not predictable.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Scarring:</strong> Fillers should not be used in patients with
          know susceptibility to keloid formation or hypertrophic scarring. The
          safety of patients has not been studied.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Unsatisfactory Result:</strong> Filler injections alone may
          not produce an outcome that meets your expectations for improvement in
          wrinkles or soft tissue depressions. There is the possibility of a
          poor or inadequate response from filler injection(s). Additional
          injections may be necessary. Surgical procedures or other treatments
          may be recommended in additional to additional treatments.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Unknown Risks:</strong> The long term effect of facial fillers
          beyond one year is unknown. The possibility of additional risk factors
          or complications attributable to the use of facial filler as a soft
          tissue filler may be discovered.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Combination of Procedures:</strong> In some situations,
          Botox® injections or other types of tissue filler materials may be
          used in addition to facial filler in order to specifically treat areas
          of the face or to enhance the outcome from tissue filler therapy. The
          effect of other forms of external skin treatments (laser and other
          light therapies, microdermabrasion, dermabrasion, or chemical peels)
          on skin that has been treated with facial filler is unknown.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Pregnancy and Nursing Mothers:</strong> Animal reproduction
          studies have not been performed to determine if Hyaluronic Acid Filler
          or other facial fillers could produce fetal harm. It is not known if
          Hyaluronic Acid Filler or its breakdown products can be excreted in
          human milk. It is not recommended that pregnant women or nursing
          mothers receive Hyaluronic Acid Filler or other facial filler
          treatments.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Drug Interactions:</strong> It is not known if facial filler
          reacts with other drugs within the body.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Long-Term Effects:</strong> Hyaluronic Acid Filler or other
          facial filler injections should not be considered as a permanent
          treatment for the correction of wrinkles and soft tissue depressions.
          Over time, the facial filler material is slowly absorbed by the body
          and wrinkles or soft tissue depressions will reappear. Continuing
          facial filler treatment (injections) is necessary in order to maintain
          the effect of the Filler. Subsequent alterations in face and eyelid
          appearance may occur as the result of aging, weight loss or gain, sun
          exposure, or other circumstances not related to Facial Filler
          injections. Future surgery or other treatments may be necessary.
          Facial Filler injection does not arrest the aging process or produce
          permanent tightening of the skin or improvement in wrinkles.

        <h2>ADDITIONAL ADVISORIES</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Female Patient Information:</strong> It is important to inform
          your plastic surgeon if you use birth control pills, estrogen
          replacement, or if you suspect you may be pregnant. Many medications
          including antibiotics may neutralize the preventive effect of birth
          control pills, allowing for conception and pregnancy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Mental Health Disorders and Elective Surgery:</strong> It is
          important that all patients seeking to undergo elective surgery have
          realistic expectations that focus on improvement rather than
          perfection. Complications or less than satisfactory results are
          sometimes unavoidable, may require additional surgery and often are
          stressful. Please openly discuss with your surgeon, prior to surgery,
          any history that you may have of significant emotional depression or
          mental health disorders. Although many individuals may benefit
          psychologically from the results of elective surgery, effects on
          mental health cannot be accurately predicted.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Sun Exposure – Direct or Tanning Salon:</strong> The effects
          of the sun are damaging to the skin. Exposing the treated areas to sun
          may result in increased scarring, color changes, and poor healing.
          Patients who tan, either outdoors or in a salon, should inform their
          surgeon and either delay treatment, or avoid tanning until the surgeon
          says it is safe to resume. The damaging effect of sun exposure occurs
          even with the use sun block or clothing coverage.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Medications and Herbal Dietary Supplements:</strong> There are
          potential adverse reactions that occur as the result of taking
          over-the-counter, herbal, and/or prescription medications. Aspirin and
          medications that contain aspirin interfere with clotting and can cause
          more bleeding. These include non-steroidal anti-inflammatories such as
          Motrin, Advil, and Alleve. It is very important not to stop drugs that
          interfere with platelets, such as Plavix, which is used after a stent.
          It is important if you have had a stent and are taking Plavix that you
          inform the plastic surgeon. Stopping Plavix may result in a heart
          attack, stroke and even death. Be sure to check with your physician
          about any drug interactions that may exist with medications which you
          are already taking. If you have an adverse reaction, stop the drugs
          immediately and call your plastic surgeon for further instructions. If
          the reaction is severe, go immediately to the nearest emergency room.
          When taking the prescribed pain medications after surgery, realize
          that they can affect your thought process and coordination. Do not
          drive, do not operate complex equipment, do not make any important
          decisions and do not drink any alcohol while taking these medications.
          Be sure to take your prescribed medication only as directed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Travel Plans:</strong> Any surgery holds the risk of
          complications that may delay healing and delay your return to normal
          life. Please let the surgeon know of any travel plans, important
          commitments already scheduled or planned, or time demands that are
          important to you, so that appropriate timing of surgery can occur.
          There are no guarantees that you will be able to resume all activities
          in the desired time frame.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Off-Label FDA Issues:</strong> There are many devices,
          medications and injectable fillers and botulinum toxins that are
          approved for specific use by the FDA, but this proposed use is
          “Off-Label”, that is not specifically approved by the FDA. It is
          important that you understand this proposed use is not experimental
          and your physician believe it to be safe and effective. Examples of
          commonly accepted “Off-Label” use of drugs or devices include the use
          of aspirin for prevention of heart disease, retinoids for skin care,
          and injection of botulinum toxin for wrinkles around the eyes.

        <p>
          There are many variable conditions in addition to risk and potential
          complications that may influence the long-term result of facial filler
          injections. Even though risks and complications occur infrequently,
          the risks cited are the ones that are particularly associated with
          Facial Filler injections. Other complications and risks can occur but
          are even more uncommon. Should complications occur, additional surgery
          or other treatments may be necessary. The practice of medicine and
          surgery is not an exact science. Although good results are expected,
          there is no guarantee or warranty expressed or implied, on the results
          that may be obtained.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="text-lg font-bold">HEALTH INSURANCE</p>
        <p>
          Most health insurance companies exclude coverage for cosmetic surgical
          procedures and treatments or any complications that might occur from
          the same. Health insurance companies may not pay for facial filler
          injections used to treat medical conditions. Please carefully review

        <p className="text-lg font-bold">FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
        <p>
          The cost of filler injection may involve several charges. This
          includes the professional fee for the injections, followup visits to
          monitor the effectiveness of the treatment, and the cost of the filler
          material itself. It is unlikely that filler injections to treat
          cosmetic problems would be covered by your health insurance. The fees
          charged for this procedure do not include any potential future costs
          for additional procedures that you elect to have or require in order
          to revise, optimize, or complete your outcome. Additional costs may
          occur should complications develop from the injections and will also
          be your responsibility. In signing the consent for this
          surgery/procedure, you acknowledge that you have been informed about
          its risk and consequences and accept responsibility for the clinical

          Informed-consent documents are used to communicate information about
          the proposed surgical treatment of a disease or condition along with
          disclosure of risks and alternative forms of treatment(s). The
          informed-consent process attempts to define principles of risk
          disclosure that should generally meet the needs of most patients in
          most circumstances. However, informed-consent documents should not be
          considered all-inclusive in defining other methods of care and risks
          encountered. Your plastic surgeon may provide you with additional or
          different information which is based on all of the facts pertaining to
          your particular case and the current state of medical knowledge.
          Informed-consent documents are not intended to define or serve as the
          standard of medical care. Standards of medical care are determined on
          the basis of all of the facts involved in an individual case and are
          subject to change as scientific knowledge and technology advance and
          as practice patterns evolve.

          1. I hereby authorize Dr.Hailey Park, DNP as may be selected to
          perform the following procedure or treatment:{" "}

          2. I recognize that during the course of the procedure and medical
          treatment or anesthesia, unforeseen conditions may necessitate
          different procedures than those above. I therefore authorize the above
          physician and assistants or designees to perform such other procedures
          that are in the exercise of his or her professional judgment necessary
          and desirable. The authority granted under this paragraph shall
          include all conditions that require treatment and are not known to my
          physician at the time the procedure is begun.

          3. I consent to the administration of such anesthetics considered
          necessary or advisable. I understand that all forms of anesthesia
          involve risk and the possibility of complications, injury, and
          sometimes death.

        <li>
          4. I understand what my surgeon can and cannot do, and understand
          there are no warranties or guarantees, implied or specific about my
          outcome. I have had the opportunity to explain my goals and understand
          which desired outcomes are realistic and which are not. All of my
          questions have been answered, and I understand the inherent (specific)
          risks to the procedures I seek, as well as those additional risks and
          complications, benefits, and alternatives. Understanding all of this,
          I elect to proceed.

        <li>
          5. I consent to be photographed or televised before, during, and after
          the operation(s) or procedure(s) to be performed, including
          appropriate portions of my body, for medical, scientific or
          educational purposes, provided my identity is not revealed by the
