          Client Treatment Consent and Release
        </p>
        <p>
          I acknowledge that beauty treatments, the practice of skin care, and
          the practice of massage, including, but not limited to, brown spot
          removal, BOTOX, Collagen, Dermal Fillers, Mesotherapy, Dermaplaning,
          and various other beauty procedures is not an exact science and no
          specific guaranties can or have been made concerning the outcome. I
          understand that some clients experience more change and improvement
          than others. In virtually all cases, multiple treatments are required
          in order to realize a difference.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I also understand and agree to assume the following risks and hazards
          which may occur in connection with any particular treatment including
          but not limited to: unsatisfactory results, soreness, poor healing,
          discomfort, redness, blistering, nerve damage, scarring, infection,
          and change in skin pigmentation, allergic reaction, muscle damage, and
          increased hair growth. I understand that even though precautions may
          be taken in my treatment, not all risks can be known in advance.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Given the above, I understand that response to treatment varies on an
          individual basis and that specific results are not guaranteed.
          Therefore, in consideration for any treatment received, I agree to
          unconditionally defend, hold harmless and release from any and all
          liability the company and the individual that provided my treatment,
          the insured, and any additional insuredâ€™s, as well as any officers,
          directors, or employees of the above companies for any condition or
          result, known or unknown, that may arise as a consequence of any
          treatment that I receive.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have fully disclosed on my client intake form any medications,
          previous complications, or current conditions that may affect my
          treatment. I understand and agree that any legal action of any kind
          related to any treatment I receive will be limited to binding
          arbitration using a single arbitrator agreed to by both parties.
